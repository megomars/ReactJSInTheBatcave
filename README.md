# ReactJS in the Batcave

* React is mostly the V in the MVC framework (The data is the **MODEL**, or the real world thing; The **VIEW** is how the reader interacts or sees your app; The **CONTROLLER** is the bridge between the **MODEL** and the **VIEW**, it decides what to do with input.)
* There are three building blocks in React:
    * Components
    * State
    * Props
