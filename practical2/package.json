  "description": "* React is mostly the V in the MVC framework (The data is the **MODEL**, or the real world thing; The **VIEW** is how the reader interacts or sees your app; The **CONTROLLER** is the bridge between the **MODEL** and the **VIEW**, it decides what to do with input.) * There are three building blocks in React:     * Components          - The very first thing that I should learn is how to write components          - A component is either created stateless or with a state             - if you're creating a stateless component then just use a normal JS function.             ```JS             function ClasslessComponent(props) {                 return(                     <h1>{props.name}</h1>                 );             }             ReactDOM.render(                 <UserDetails name={name}/>,                 document.getElementById(\"app\")             )             ```",
